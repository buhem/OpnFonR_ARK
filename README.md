# OpnFonR_ARK

OpnFonR_ARK is a URN resolver dedicated to Archival Resource Key (ARK) identifier. From a PID, OpnFonR_ARK will redirect the user to the digital location, a URL, of a particular digital object (image, sound, text, etc).

The current version is mainly developed for the OpnFonR digital repository ([Click here](https://sudoranais.shinyapps.io/Analysis_Processing_Rhotic_Alveolar/)), but it can be applied to any repository. In the coming versions of OpnFonR_ARK, I intend to extend it to other URNs, notably ISSN and DOI. 

A prototype is available at: https://arkopenfonr-g3q3eh375a-uc.a.run.app. To run an example, put the following address in your web browser: https://arkopenfonr-g3q3eh375a-uc.a.run.app/ark:/00000/1/0009/informant_1/abrid.wav.
